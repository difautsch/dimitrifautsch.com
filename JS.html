<div id="remingtonchopbody"> <p>The Remington Chop was a first-time culinary event that took place on June 13th in the Remington neighborhood of Baltimore City. When we started, our mission was to host an event that brought people to a lesser-known neighborhood of Baltimore and give our guests a chance to learn from local chefs. We choose Remington for its burgeoning culinary scene and because of the efforts of the neighborhood to help us put the event together.</p></div>
